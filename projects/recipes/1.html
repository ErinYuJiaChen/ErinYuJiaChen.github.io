		<h1>Steamed cabbage rolls</h1>
		<h3>Background/intro</h3>
		<pre>
Me and my friend tested this recipe out once, and my family has been occasionally making it for dinner sometimes.<br> It's very yummy, and I would even say it's pretty healthy. You can add pretty<br> much anything to these dumplings! you can wrap it with mushrooms, noodles, vegetables, and more. This version <br> will just be the plain recipe. "They're pretty fun to make, but make enough so your family doesn't eat it in 2<br> seconds." - My dad

		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ol>

			<li>Bring a pot of water to a boil.</li>
			<li>When the water is boiling, dip the cabbage leaves in<br> the boiling water for about 15-30 seconds. Take it out when its<br> slightly softened.</li>
			<li>Lay out the cabbage leaves on a cutting board, and<br> pat them dry with a paper towel.</li>
			<li>Place 1 1/2 tbsp of the pork onto the bottom of the<br> Leaf. Roll up the cabbage, like you would a burrito.</li>

If you have a steamer, you are welcome to use that. <br> Once the water comes to a boil, place the dumplings onto the <br> plate and steam them for about 12-15 minutes. Make sure the meat is thoroughly cooked,<br> and theres no pink in the middle.</li>
