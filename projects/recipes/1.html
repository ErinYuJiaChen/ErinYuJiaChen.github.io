		<h3>Background/intro</h3>
		<pre>
Me and my friend tested this recipe out once, and my family has been occasionally making it for dinner sometimes. It's very yummy, and I would even say it's pretty healthy. You can add pretty much anything to these dumplings! you can wrap it with mushrooms, noodles, vegetables, and more. This version will just be the plain recipe. "They're pretty fun to make, but make enough so your family doesn't eat it in 2 seconds." - My dad
