		<h3>Background/intro</h3>
		<pre>
Me and my friend tested this recipe out once, and my family has been occasionally making it for dinner sometimes.<br> It's very yummy, and I would even say it's pretty healthy. You can add pretty<br> much anything to these dumplings! you can wrap it with mushrooms, noodles, vegetables, and more. This version <br> will just be the plain recipe. "They're pretty fun to make, but make enough so your family doesn't eat it in 2<br> seconds." - My dad

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>This recipe requires you to handle raw meat, so cook until the internal temperature of the pork is 155 degrees farenheight!
			<li>Wash hands after touching the meat, and don't touch anything else with your hands before washing them!
		</ul>
