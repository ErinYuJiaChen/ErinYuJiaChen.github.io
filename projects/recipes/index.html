		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p></p>
		<h3>Hi! I'm Erin. This is my recipe page.</h3>
		<pre>My grandparents carried down their
Taiwanese culture to America.
My family is ethnically Chinese, but
most of my relatives are located in
Taiwan. The main cuisine that we choose
to eat is Asian. Although my family does
make a lot of Asian dishes, we also make
a variety of other cuisine too. I'm going
to share some simple recipes that my
family enjoys.
