This is my second recipe! I hope nobody sees this and steals it... but yeah.
This is my mom's mom's tofu recipe. I have no idea where she got it from,
and I can't really ask her. Maybe she got it from her relatives, or made it?
My dad has been making this tofu for the family for as long as I can
remember. It's really good, and you usually make it as a side dish paired
with rice and something else. "Great comfort food." -My dad again...</pre>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The tofu is really soft... so cut it however you like.</li>
			<li>Don't stir too hard and break the tofu!!!</li>
		</ul>
